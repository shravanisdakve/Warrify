# Demo Invoices

This folder is intended to hold sample invoice images (e.g., JPEG, PNG) that you can use to test the OCR functionality of the Warrify application.

## How to use:
1. Place a sample invoice image here. Make sure it contains a product name/model, brand (e.g., Samsung, LG), date (e.g., 28 Feb 2026), and invoice number.
2. Go to the "Add Product" page in the Warrify app.
3. Click "Upload Invoice" and select your image from this folder.
4. Watch the OCR automatically extract the details!
